## üó®Ô∏è PRESENTATION

This sets up my dev environment easily on any machine.
This project was inspired by [Tsoding daily](https://www.youtube.com/@TsodingDaily). Especially his emacs setup. It looks like my old one on steroids.
This setup might not work for everyone. This is very personal to me.
